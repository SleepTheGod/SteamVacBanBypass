# Steam VAC Ban Bypass
A fully automated, advanced Steam VAC ban bypass tool utilizing hooking techniques to manipulate system calls and patch memory for bypassing Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) in Steam games. This project uses advanced reverse engineering practices, efficient memory manipulation, and IAT (Import Address Table) hooking to patch specific checks in Steam's VAC protection.

# Features
VAC Bypass Patches memory to disable certain checks within Steam's VAC system.
IAT Hooking Hooks key Windows API functions like LoadLibraryExW for Steam client and Steam services.
Pattern Scanning Finds specific byte patterns in the memory of Steam modules to locate and patch vulnerable areas.
Detailed Logging Logs all operations for debugging and tracking using hook_log.txt.
Modular Structure Separated utility functions, hook functions, and main logic for cleaner and more maintainable code.
Error Handling Robust error checking and logging to ensure smooth operation and easy debugging.

# Requirements
Windows This tool is designed specifically for Windows platforms.
C++ Compiler Requires a modern C++ compiler, like MSVC or MinGW, to compile the DLL.
Steam Steam must be installed and running for this tool to attach and modify the processes.

# Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SleepTheGod/SteamVacBanBypass.git
cd SteamVacBanBypass
```

# Build the DLL
Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Visual Studio) or use MinGW.
Compile the project to generate the DLL.

Inject the DLL
Use your preferred DLL injection method (you can use open-source injectors or create a simple injector).
Inject the compiled DLL into the Steam process or any VAC-protected game running under Steam.

# Usage
Run Steam and ensure the game you wish to use is VAC-protected.
Inject the DLL using a DLL injector.
Verify logs
The tool will log all the hooking, pattern scanning, and patching activities into hook_log.txt for debugging and verification.
Enjoy: The VAC ban checks should now be bypassed.

# Code Structure
dllmain.cpp The main entry point for the DLL. Handles initialization, pattern scanning, memory patching, and IAT hooking.
utils.h / utils.cpp Utility functions such as pattern scanning, import hooking, module enumeration, and logging.
hooks.h / hooks.cpp Hook function declarations and implementations for overriding specific Windows API calls.

# How It Works
The bypass works by using a combination of pattern scanning and IAT hooking

# Pattern Scanning
It locates specific byte patterns within Steam's memory space that correspond to VAC's protection mechanisms.
Once found, the vulnerable area of memory is patched to disable VAC's checks.

# IAT Hooking
The tool hooks into key system calls such as LoadLibraryExW to intercept and control the loading of certain Steam modules.
This allows the tool to prevent VAC from fully initializing or checking game data.

# Memory Protection
The tool uses VirtualProtect to safely change the memory permissions of the target memory regions so that they can be modified.
After modifying the memory, the permissions are restored.

# Advanced Features
Modular Codebase The project is structured with clear separation of concerns between utilities, hooks, and the main logic.
Logging: Every significant action (e.g., memory patching, hook installation, errors) is logged to a file for easy debugging and verification.
Compatibility Designed to be compatible with the latest version of Steam and most VAC-protected games.
